The R codes provided here are related to the project report "Can Maths Beat the Bookies" by Bradley Maunder.
This project is provided in the repository in pdf format.

Both "FASTCODES.R" and "CODES.R" in the repository provide the same results however:

FASTCODES:
To just see the estimated parameters from Model 1 and Model 2 and/or make use
of the prob,probsc,prob2.5 or STRATEGY functions please see "FASTCODES.R" and follow the instructions provided.

CODES:
To follow the derivation of the estimation of parameters and
setting up of functions please see "CODES.R" and follow the instructions provided. 
Of course you can still make use of the estimated parameters and functions here.
